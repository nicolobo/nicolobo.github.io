<h2></b>Welcome!</h2>

My name is Nicolás Varela García, I'm currently a Predoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://www.uc3m.es/social-sciences-department/home">Universidad Carlos III de Madrid</a>, where I lecture and I'm a candidate in the PhD program in Economic History.

<br>
<br>

My <a href="https://nicolobo.github.io/research.html">research</a> focuses on the monetary policy of the francoist regime, for which I explore: 1)The distribution of power among the different actors involved in policymaking; 2)The joint evolution of the different indicators and their causality relationships; and 3)The differential impact of monetary policy in and the role of the private banking system.
