<h2></b>Welcome!</h2>

I'm Nicolás Varela García, PhD (Permanently halfway Done) candidate in Economic History at the <a href="https://www.uc3m.es/social-sciences-department/home">Universidad Carlos III de Madrid</a>. After 6 fantastic years at Madrid, I found a second home in Paris while visiting the <a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/recherche/groupes-de-recherche-thematiques/histoire-economique-et-sociale/"><em>Histoire économique et sociale</em> group</a> at Paris School of Economics - École d'économie de Paris.

<br>
<br>

My <a href="https://nicolobo.github.io/research.html">research</a> focuses on the political economy of Spanish monetary policy during the Francoist dictatorship. In my thesis I: 
<ol>
    <li> Map the power distribution among de iure and de facto policymakers in the monetary policy decision-making process by making use of the narrative analysis of internal documentation.</li>
    <li> Assess the monetary policy transmission mechanism thorugh the retrieval and econometric analysis of coetaneous indicators of monetary policy and the interbank market.</li>
    <li> Evaluate the differential benefits experienced by the banking system derived from their unequal operational scales and connections to the regime.</li>
</ol>
