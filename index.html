I am a Predoctoral Fellow in Economic History at the [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/social-sciences-department/home).

My href="https://nicolobo.github.io/research.md">research [research](./research.html) focuses on political violence. In particular, I use a variety of quantitative methods to understand social and political dynamics in the aftermath of violent conflicts. My book project investigates the long-term consequences of civilian victimization and develops a new theory on how and under which circumstances violence leaves persistent legacies. Part of my research has been published or conditionally accepted at *The Journal of Politics*, the *Journal of Peace Research*, and the *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, among others.
