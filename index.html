<h2></b>Welcome!</h2>

I'm Nicolás Varela García, PhD candidate in Economic History at the <a href="https://www.uc3m.es/social-sciences-department/home">Universidad Carlos III de Madrid</a>.

<br>
<br>

My <a href="https://nicolobo.github.io/research.html">research</a> focuses on the political economy of Spanish monetary policy during the Francoist dictatorship. In my thesis I intend to: 
<ol>
    <li> Map the power distribution among de iure and de facto policymakers by making use of the narrative analysis of inside documentation.</li>
    <li> Assess the performance of monetary policy instruments regarding coetaneous policy targets.</li>
    <li> Evaluate the differential benefits experienced by the banking system derived from their unequal connections to the regime.</li>
</ol>
